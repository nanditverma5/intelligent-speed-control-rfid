# 🚗 Intelligent Vehicle Speed Control System (RFID-Based)

An embedded system designed to **automatically regulate vehicle speed** in restricted and high-risk zones using **RFID technology**.  
Whenever the vehicle passes through an area with a specific RFID tag (School Zone, Hospital Zone, etc.), the system **limits the motor speed** accordingly.
